The purpose of this app is to use computer vision to analyze photos of train route maps or bus route maps.
The AI can determine how optimized and efficient the route is by comparing it to the characteristics of slime mold

Multiple studies have proved the efficiency of this method but this is the first attempt to use computer vision to provide analytics of this nature
Here is an example where a slime mold recreates the highly engineered map of the Tokyo transit system:
